# Happlications

This app helps log and keep track of job applications. The information it asks for is name of the role, name of the company, date of application and whether there was an interview following the application. It also features a dark mode toggle button for accessibility.

The frameworks used to create this app are Ruby on Rails for the backend, React for the frontend and milligram and CSS for styling.
